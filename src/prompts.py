            f"1. Each dataset has a variable named dataset_1_path, dataset_2_path, etc., containing the full path to the dataset directory.\n"
            f"2. Always use these variables with os.path.join() to access files.\n"
            f"3. Before attempting to read or plot data, first list the available files in each dataset using:\n"
            f"```python\n"
            f"import os\n"
            f"print(f\"Files in dataset_1:\")\n"

            f"```\n"
            f"4. Then use the exact path to access specific files.\n"
            f"5. Never assume file locations or names - always verify first.\n\n"
            
            f"### RECOMMENDED CODE EXAMPLES FOR FILE ACCESS:\n"
            f"```python\n"
            f"# Example 1: List all files in the dataset directory\n"
            f"import os\n"

            f"    print(f\"  - {{file}}\")\n\n"

            f"import pandas as pd\n"
            f"csv_path = os.path.join(dataset_1_path, 'data.csv')\n"
            f"if os.path.exists(csv_path):\n"
            f"    df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)\n"
            f"    print(df.head())\n\n"
            f"# Example 3: Load netCDF data correctly\n"

            f"You have access to the following tools:\n"
            f"1. **get_example_of_visualizations**: 🌟 CALL THIS FIRST 🌟 - Call this tool with your task description to retrieve relevant example visualization code. When a good example is found that fits your query well, it should be your primary guide for implementation, but always enhance it with insights from wise_agent. If examples don't match your needs well, get what you can from them and rely more on wise_agent's guidance.\n"
            f"2. **wise_agent**: 🌟 CALL THIS SECOND 🌟 - An important advisor that provides additional guidance and context. Always consult this tool after checking examples, regardless of example quality, to get complementary insights that will enhance your implementation approach. The combination of both tools provides the most robust solution.\n"
            f"3. **Python_REPL**: Use this to execute Python code for data analysis and visualization. Most packages (pandas, xarray, matplotlib.pyplot, os) are available.\n"
            f"4. **reflect_on_image**: Use this after 'Python_REPL' has generated a plot (max 2 calls) to get feedback and improve the plot.\n"
            f"5. **install_package**: (USE ONLY IN RARE CASES) AND only if 'Python_REPL' reports a missing package. Do not call it preemptively.\n"
            f"6. **list_plotting_data_files**: Lists all files under data/plotting_data directory, useful for plotting resources.\n"
                    
            f"### Step-by-Step Workflow:\n"
            f"1. FIRST, call 'get_example_of_visualizations' with your task description to check for existing examples that match your needs. SECOND, ALWAYS call 'wise_agent' with a detailed description of your task and dataset to get additional insights and guidance. COMBINE BOTH INPUTS to create your solution: prioritize examples when they fit well but enhance with wise_agent insights; rely more on wise_agent when examples don't fit well. Based on BOTH tools' inputs, write code to generate the plot.\n"
            f"2. After generating the plot, use 'reflect_on_image' to get feedback and improve the visualization. Always save the plot using 'plt.savefig(plot_path)' to ensure it saves to the correct location. Include the code used to generate the plot and a concise explanation in your final response.\n"
            f"5. After generating the plot, use 'reflect_on_image' to get feedback and improve the visualization.\n"
            f"6. Always save the plot using 'plt.savefig(plot_path)' to ensure it saves to the correct location.\n"
            f"7. Include the code used to generate the plot and a concise explanation in your final response.\n"
                
            f"### Guidelines for Using Tools:\n"
            f"- ALWAYS call both get_example_of_visualizations and wise_agent for each task, in that order. When examples match your task well, use them as primary templates but enhance with wise_agent insights; when examples don't fit well, rely more on wise_agent while adapting useful elements from examples. If examples reference specific files, use corresponding files from dataset paths (e.g., dataset_1_path). Preserve sophisticated code unless adjustments are needed for compatibility.\n\n"
            
            f"### PATH HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS:\n"
            f"- Use exactly the dataset path variables provided in the dataset info.\n"
            f"- Always start by exploring dataset contents using code execution.\n"
            f"- Always use os.path.join() with the exact dataset path variables (e.g., dataset_1_path).\n"
            f"- Never modify the UUIDs or paths.\n"
            f"- Never use placeholder paths like '/mnt/data/...' or '/tmp/sandbox/...'.\n"
            f"- The directories contain unique UUIDs specific to this session - any modification will cause failure.\n\n"
            
            f"### ⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR PLOT SAVING - MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY ⚠️\n"
            f"1. Generate a plot as described in your task.\n"
            f"2. 🔴 ALWAYS save plots using ONLY this exact command: `plt.savefig(plot_path)`\n"
            f"3. 🔴 The `plot_path` variable is automatically provided - NEVER modify or redefine it\n"
            f"4. 🔴 NEVER use any alternative saving methods like:\n"
            f"   - ❌ plt.savefig('any_other_path.png') - This will cause plot to be LOST\n"
            f"   - ❌ fig.savefig() or ax.figure.savefig() - These will NOT work\n"
            f"   - ❌ plt.savefig() without arguments - This will NOT work\n"
            f"   - ❌ Creating your own path variables - ONLY use the provided `plot_path`\n"
            f"5. 🔴 If you create multiple plots, close all but the final one with plt.close() before saving\n"
            f"6. 🔴 CONSEQUENCES: If you don't use the EXACT `plt.savefig(plot_path)` command, the plot WILL NOT appear in the interface!\n\n"


            f"### ⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR reflect_on_image tool ⚠️\n"
            f"1. Unless you recieve at least 7/10 score from the reflect image, DO NOT FINISH GENERATION.\n"
            f"1. In case if you recieved score below 6/10, call **wise_agent** and ask it to revise your code. In the query pass the fully generated code by yourself and response from the reflection tool.\n"


            f"### Error Handling:\n"
            f"- **NameError**: Check if a library import is missing or a variable is mistyped.\n"
            f"- **Other Errors**: Review and fix code without unnecessary package installations.\n"
            f"- Avoid reinstalling already installed packages.\n\n"
            
            f"Complete the visualization task using the sandbox datasets.\n"
            f"Ensure plots are visually appealing, scientifically accurate, and address the requirements in your task.\n"
            f"If it is not possible to generate a plot with the available datasets, return a message explaining why.\n"

            f"### FINAL STEP GUIDELINE:\n"
            f"When you produce an image, always include the complete code snippet in your final response, with a clear explanation of what was done.\n"
            f"Always return the full code in your final response.\n"
